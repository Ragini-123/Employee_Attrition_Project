# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project analyzes IBM HR data to uncover the key factors driving employee attrition using Python and Power BI.

## Objective
To identify early indicators of employee resignation by performing exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling using IBM's HR dataset.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)

## Key Tasks
- Cleaned and preprocessed the HR dataset.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and statistical methods.
- Investigated correlations and key patterns across job roles, satisfaction levels, and salary.
- Built a Logistic Regression model to predict attrition and identify top contributing features.
- Created Power BI dashboards to visualize trends and generate HR insights.

## Key Insights
- Employees working overtime or earning lower salaries are more likely to leave.
- Job role, environment satisfaction, and distance from home are strong attrition indicators.
- Logistic Regression revealed 'OverTime', 'MonthlyIncome', and 'JobRole' as top features affecting attrition.

## Project Files
- `IBM_Employee_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb`: Complete EDA and Logistic Regression model notebook.
- Power BI dashboards (optional): Visual summaries for HR team use.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter.
3. Run each cell in sequence to perform the analysis.
